# NLP-LSTM-and-GRU
doing some cool project in sentiment analysis using deep learning and NLP
this is aa=nother amazing porject on sentiment analysis where i used the twitter dataset about 1.6 million tweets
here build a model using LSTM and GRU whuch one of the top deep learning techiques used in sentiment anslysis apart of that i preprossed i=the texr used some cool NLP techniques 
and plot model flow , ROC Confusion maertrics at the end of the code

# Intro- LSTM and GRU
# LSTM
Long Short-Term Memory networks – usually just called “LSTMs” – are a special kind of RNN, capable of learning long-term dependencies They work tremendously well on a large variety of problems and are now widely used. LSTMs are explicitly designed to avoid the long-term dependency problem. Remembering information for long periods is practically their default behaviour, not something they struggle to learn
# GRU

The GRU is the newer generation of Recurrent Neural networks and is pretty similar to an LSTM. GRU’s got rid of the cell state and used the hidden state to transfer information. It also only has two gates, a reset gate and update gate.

# want to know about it more go to through this amazing intro about LSTM and GRU
